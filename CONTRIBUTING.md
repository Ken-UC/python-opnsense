Contributing to Python-OPNsense
========================

Thank you for considering a pull request or issue report. Below are a few hints and tips in order to make them as effective as possible. That said, I'd lke to stress that I value the interaction over how well it conforms to the guidelines below. If you have feedback you'd like to share, but you don't quite know how it fits the guidelines, then forget about the guidelines; we can work it out on the fly :-)

Issue reports
-------------

Issue reports can be bug reports or feature requests.  Make sure to
search the open and closed issues before adding a new one.  It is
often better to join an ongoing discussions on similar open issues
than creating a new one as there may be workarounds or ideas available.

When creating bug reports, please make sure you provide the following:

* The Python-OPNsense version in which you first experienced the bug
* If possible, the last Python-OPNsense version in which the bug did not exist
* A list of steps or code snippet that can be used to replicate the bug

Issue templates can help with getting this just right.

All issues reported will have to be triaged and prioritized.  As we
are probably just me, I may not always have the time to implement and help,
but reporting an issue may help others, but probably me, to fill in.

The issue categories are as follows:

* support: community-based help figuring out setup issues or code problems
* cleanup: some deprecated code I forgot to remove, etc.
* bug: identified operational bug (core features, etc.)
* feature: behavioral changes, additions as well as missing options
* help wanted: a contributor is missing to carry out the work
* upstream: problem exists in the included third-party software
* incomplete: issue template missing or incomplete

Feature requests that are in line with project goals will eventually
be added to the roadmap, which itself will eventually be created and accessible at:

https://turnbros.app/projects/python-opnsense/about/road-map/

Stale issues might be timed out after 180 days inactivity.  Please
note that this includes non-support issues such as feature requests
that are not picked up by a contributor, which means it is highly
unlikely the feature will be implemented in the first place unless a
pull request is provided along with the issue.

Responding to issues is completely voluntary for all participants.
As a general rule, closed tickets shall and will not be responded to.

And above all: stay kind and open.  :)

Pull requests
-------------

When creating pull request, please heed the following:

* Base your code on the latest master branch to avoid manual merges
* Code review may ensue in order to help shape your proposal
* Pull request must adhere to Apache License 2.0 licensing
* Explain the problem and your proposed solution
