# Security Policy

A concerted effort has been made to keep this library as simple as possible while only leveraging external libraries when absolutely necessary. That said, I'm not perfect and mistakes happen. If you discover a vulnerability, please do myself and those that use this library a favor by following the vulnerability reporting instructions below.

Thank you.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have encountered a potential security vulnerability in this project, please report it to me at dylanturn@gmail.com. I will work with you to verify the vulnerability and patch it.

When reporting issues, please provide the following information:
  - Component(s) affected
